# Cloudflare Pages Build Configuration

## Dashboard Settings (REQUIRED for Git Integration)

Go to your Cloudflare Pages project → **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**

### Framework preset
Select: **Next.js (Static HTML Export)**

### Build settings
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Build output directory**: `out`
- **Root directory**: `/` (leave as default)

### Environment variables
Add these in the dashboard:
- **NODE_VERSION**: `18` (or `20`)

## Alternative: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually from your local machine:

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy the out folder
wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=tmkdo
```

Or use the combined command:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Important Notes

- The `out` directory is generated by `npm run build` and contains your static site
- This directory is in `.gitignore` and should NOT be committed
- Cloudflare Pages will build it automatically when configured in the dashboard
- For git-based deployments, you MUST configure build settings in the dashboard
